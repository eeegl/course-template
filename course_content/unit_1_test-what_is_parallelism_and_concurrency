Page_name: What is parallelism and concurrency?

1. Concurrency in programming is best described as follows:
    A) Running multiple tasks at the exact same moment. 
    - Incorrect. This definition refers to parallelism wherein execution of tasks happen at the exact same time.
    B) Handling many tasks at the same time, regardless of whether they're executed at the same moment.
    - Correct. Concurrency involves managing multiple tasks, which may or may not share the exact moment of execution.
    C) Executing programming instructions one after the other in the order they are written.
    - Incorrect. You've actually described sequential programming, a different approach entirely.

2. Parallelism in the context of programming can be best defined as:
    A) Executing tasks one after the other.
    - Incorrect. You are referring to sequential programming where operations are performed one after another.
    B) Handling multiple tasks simultaneously, regardless if they are executed at the same moment.
    - Incorrect. Parallelism involves executing multiple tasks at the same moment, which is different from handling them.
    C) Running multiple tasks at the exact same moment.
    - Correct. Parallel programming focuses on the simultaneous execution of tasks.

3. Which of the following best represents the concept of sequential programming?
    A) Executing programming instructions one after the other in the order they are written.
    - Correct. Sequential programming involves executing operations one after another in the order they're written.
    B) Running multiple tasks at the exact same moment.
    - Incorrect. You've described parallel programming, not sequential programming.
    C) Handling many tasks simultaneously, regardless of whether they're executed at the same moment.
    - Incorrect. You are referring to concurrent programming which involves managing multiple tasks in an overlapping manner.

4. Consider the following scenario: a web server handling multiple client requests. What advantage does concurrent programming offer in this context?
    A) It handles all client requests at the exact same moment.
    - Incorrect. This describes parallel programming. Concurrent programming may not necessarily handle all tasks at the exact same moment.
    B) It ensures sequential execution of requests thus making debugging easier.
    - Incorrect. This attribute is emphasized in sequential programming, not concurrency.
    C) It manages multiple client requests efficiently even if they don't execute simultaneously.
    - Correct. Concurrent programming can improve server responsiveness by managing multiple client requests at once.

5. Let's analyze the following Go code snippet:
   ```
   var a [10]int 
   for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
     a[i] = i+1
   }
   ``` 
   Which programming paradigm does it showcase?
    A) Concurrent programming.
    - Incorrect. The Go code snippet shown does not use any constructs that allow for concurrency, such as goroutines or channels.
    B) Parallel programming.
    - Incorrect. The code does not feature any elements of parallel execution, like goroutines running synchronously.
    C) Sequential programming.
    - Correct. This code snippet indicates sequential programming, following the order each operation is written.

6. When programming in Go, we utilize goroutines to implement which programming paradigm?
    A) Concurrent programming.
    - Correct. Goroutines are the backbone of concurrency in Go, allowing for efficient management of multiple tasks.
    B) Sequential programming.
    - Incorrect. Goroutines enhance Go's ability to handle multiple tasks at once and are not involved in executing one task after another.
    C) Parallel programming.
    - Incorrect. While goroutines can operate in parallel with a multi-core processor, their primary purpose is to allow for concurrent, not parallel.

7. In Go, what is the primary purpose of channels?
    A) To implement sequential programming.
    - Incorrect. Channels are not specific to sequential programming.
    B) To implement parallel programming.
    - Incorrect. Channels help in managing data communication between goroutines, which is a characteristic of concurrent programming.
    C) To facilitate communication between goroutines in concurrent programming.
    - Correct. Channels in Go are crucial for communication and data sharing between concurrently running goroutines.

8. Which keyword is used to initiate a goroutine in Go?
    A) `go`.
    - Correct. In Go, we use the `go` keyword to initiate a new goroutine.
    B) `goroutine`.
    - Incorrect. 'goroutine' is the term used to refer to threads in Go, but it isn't the keyword to initiate a new goroutine.
    C) `goRoutine`.
    - Incorrect. 'goRoutine' is not a valid keyword in Go.

9. Given its role in concurrent programming, what is the primary benefit of using a Go channel?
    A) It allows for efficient task management.
    - Incorrect. While channels do contribute to concurrency, the primary function is not task management but inter-goroutine communication.
    B) It provides a conduit for goroutines to share and communicate data.
    - Correct. Channels in Go facilitate data sharing and communication between goroutines.
    C) It ensures simultaneous execution of multiple tasks.
    - Incorrect. Channels are not responsible for simultaneous task execution.

10. What is the effect of using the `range` keyword on a Go-lang channel?
    A) Blocks the goroutine until the channel has data to read.
    - Correct. The `range` keyword will block a goroutine until there is data in the channel.
    B) Triggers multiple executions of the goroutine.
    - Incorrect. The `range` keyword reads data from a channel and does not control the execution frequency of goroutines.
    C) Creates a new channel.
    - Incorrect. The `range` keyword does not create channels. It operates on existing ones to read data.
